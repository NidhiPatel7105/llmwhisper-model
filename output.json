Manual Testing \n\nManual testing is the process of testing the software manually without using \nany automation tools. It helps identify issues from a human perspective and \nensures usability and design consistency. \n\n40 | Page \n<<<\f\n\nNote: 100% automation is not possible, hence manual testing is always \nessential. \n\n       Types of Manual Testing \n\n Type        Description \n\n Black Box   Focuses on the functionality without knowledge of internal \n Testing     code. It checks for correct input-output behavior. \n\n White Box   Involves testing the internal logic, structure, and code paths. \n Testing     Usually done by developers. \n\n             Individual components (like a form or function) are tested in \n Unit Testing \n             isolation. \n\n2.Automation Testing \n\n Automation testing is the process of executing pre-scripted test cases using \n automation tools. The goal is to reduce the workload of repetitive testing while \n improving efficiency and consistency. \nAutomation testing reduces manual effort but does not replace manual \ntesting entirely. \n\n 41 | Page \n<<<\f\n\n  6.2 White Box Testing \n\n    White box testing techniques analyze the internal structures the used data \n    structures, internal design, code structure, and the working of the software \n    rather than just the functionality as in black box testing. It is also called glass \n    box testing or clear box testing or structural testing. White Box Testing is also \n    known as transparent testing or open box testing. White box testing is a \n    software testing technique that involves testing the internal structure and \n    workings of a software application. The tester has access to the source code \n    and uses this knowledge to design test cases that can verify the correctness of \n    the software at the code level. \n    White box testing is also known as structural testing or code-based testing, and \n    it is used to test the software's internal logic, flow, and structure. The tester \n    creates test cases to examine the code paths and logic flows to ensure they \n    meet the specified requirements. \n\n   Process of White Box Testing \n\n      Input: Requirements, Functional specifications, design documents, source \n     code. \n\n      Processing: Performing risk analysis to guide through the entire process. \n      Proper test planning: Designing test cases to cover the entire code. \n\n     Execute rinse-repeat until error-free software is reached. Also, the results \n     are communicated. \n\n      Output: Preparing final report of the entire testing process. \n\n42 | Page \n<<<\f\n\n           CHAPTER: - 7 \n\n           CONCLUSION \n\n43 | Page \n<<<\f\n\n7.1 Conclusion \n\nThe College Management System was successfully developed using front-end \ntechnologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an efficient, user- \nfriendly, and responsive platform for managing various academic operations. \nThis system facilitates core functionalities like student and teacher \nmanagement, course registration, attendance tracking, finance handling, and \ndata visualization, all within a clean and intuitive interface. The primary goal of \nstreamlining college administrative tasks has been effectively achieved through \nthis system. \n\nThorough manual and automated testing ensured that the system operates \nwith minimal bugs, meets user requirements, and maintains data accuracy and \nintegrity. The implementation of validation techniques and structured testing \nmethods such as white-box and black-box testing helped in ensuring system \nreliability and robustness. \n\nBy digitizing manual operations and reducing administrative overhead, the \nCollege Management System significantly improves productivity and \ntransparency within the institution. \n\n44 | Page \n<<<\f"
